I am a Masters student in <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/Academics/Groups/Geomatics">Geomatics at Purdue University</a>  with interest in machine and deep learning based geospatial data analytics. Currently, I am working under <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=111817">Dr Ayman Habib</a> as a member of Digital Photogrammetry Research Group (DPRG) on lane marking extraction from LiDAR intensity images through deep learning. I have also worked on satellite imagery (hyperspectral data) classification via Support Vector Machines and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7729859">Contextual Deep CNN</a>. Currently, I am seeking full time or internship opportunities in field of data analytics once I graduate in May 2020.

Apart from academics, I am a huge Manchester United fan and regularly follow them. I like to listen to and take part in enthusiastic soccer discussions. I also love cooking which is certainly not a bad skill/hobby to have as a graduate student :)
